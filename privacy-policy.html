        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <li><strong>Automatically collected data</strong> such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring pages and the pages you visit on the Site. This data is collected using standard web server logs and analytics tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Third‑party service data</strong> when you follow links to external services (for example GitHub or LinkedIn). Those services collect and process data according to their own policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Site may include links to third‑party websites or services (for example, GitHub, LinkedIn, Google Drive). Those services operate independently and have their own privacy practices. I encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing personal data to them.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Contact messages and related information will be retained only as long as necessary to respond and for a reasonable period afterwards for recordkeeping and legal compliance.</p>
